    <h1>The Shapes of Stories</h1>
    <p>
      For each of the stories below, we asked ChatGPT-3.5 who the main characters were,
      and asked it to rate their feelings at different parts of the story.
      We then graphed its answers, so you can see how the
      characters' fortune changes over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faded gray line shows ChatGPT's raw answers, while the white line shows
      a smoothed average.
      Mouse over the graphs to see ChatGPT's explanation for its choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also asked DALL-E to help us present the data by generating drawings for each character.
